\section*{3 May 2013 --- Version 0.9.9}
Quick reference has been thoroughly revised to reflect extended changes to plumbing and miscellaneous features.

\section*{28 January 2013 --- Version 0.9.9}
\st{One-liners are here!  Analysis products are returned in a list as usual, additionally containing the implied metagenome collection.  For instance: \\
\texttt{> p <- pco("4441679.3 4441680.3 4441696.3 4440463.3 4440464.3", main="my title", color="blue")} \\
\texttt{> pco(p\$collection, main="and now, in red", color="red")} \\
Similarly implemented for: \texttt{heatmap}, \texttt{sigtest}.}

These routines apply to any matrix: \\
\texttt{dist(x, method="bray-curtis")}			\\
\texttt{normalize(x)}			\\
\texttt{remove.singletons(x, lim.entry=1 , lim.row=1)}	\\
\texttt{randomize(x, n=1, method = c("sample", "dataset", "complete"), FUN=identity)}

For collections, the default view in most circumstances (e.g. analysis functions like \texttt{pco}) is the most recently constructed.

For API debugging use: \texttt{messions\$urls()}

Read metagenome IDs from file with: \texttt{collection(file="my-id-file.txt")}		\\
One ID per line, or \texttt{name<tab>ID} per line.

Read auth key from file with: \texttt{msession\$setAuth("my-key-file.txt")}

Annotation hierarchies available with: \texttt{rownames(collection, view, sep)} \\
With \texttt{sep=FALSE}, the result is a matrix: one column per hierarchy level, one row per annotation.

\section*{21 January 2013 --- Version 0.9.9}

For auth keys and other session configuration, use: \texttt{msession} (formerly \texttt{mconfig})

For bug reporting, use: \texttt{msession\$debug()} 

Collections now have four default views:	\\
raw counts (\texttt{raw})			\\
normed counts (\texttt{nrm})			\\
no singletons, raw counts (\texttt{nsc})	\\
no singletons, normed counts (\texttt{nsn})

Command reference now available with: \texttt{vignette("matR-quick-reference")}	\\
The same document is available via: \\
\texttt{https://github.com/MG-RAST/matR/raw/master/inst/doc/matR-quick-reference.pdf}

Runtime R-style help now available, such as: \texttt{?collection}	\\
For the moment, docs are by and large limited to series of examples.

Significance testing of annotations available with: \texttt{sigtest()}.

\section*{14 January 2013 --- Version 0.9.9}

This file available with: \texttt{vignette("matR-change-log")} \\
And at: \\
\texttt{https://github.com/MG-RAST/matR/raw/master/inst/doc/matR-change-log.pdf}
