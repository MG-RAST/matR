Description:
	Facilities are implemented to query and download from the
	MG-RAST metagenome analysis server.  Access to private data is authenticated.  
	Metadata is lightly encapsulated with data.  Import and export is enabled via an RBIOM class, 
	implemented as a close translation of the BIOM standard JSON format.  
	A suite of relevant statistical analysis routines is provided, currently focused on taxon and 
	function abundance.  This toolset is growing, supported by an active research effort.  Creation 
	of high-quality images in various formats is implemented with a Cairo graphics device; 
	interactive graphics remain possible with R's default capabilities.  The package 
	imports liberally from other contributed packages, but strictly depends only on base R, to 
	preserve modularity of the various components.
