matR: Metagenomics Analysis Tools for R

ABOUT
matR is an analysis client for MG-RAST built as an extension package to the popular R programming language for statistics.  This package is in development.  Facilities are implemented to download annotation data from the MG-RAST metagenome analysis server.  Easy acccess to lightly structured metadata, authentication for access to private data, and customized versions of relevant statistical and visualization tools are provided.  For a few examples, see http://dunkirk.mcs.anl.gov/~braithwaite/matR/examples.

INSTALLATION
The package can be downloaded from GitHub, or easily installed from within R.  For the latter, use:
> install.packages ("matR", repo = "http://dunkirk.mcs.anl.gov/~braithwaite/matR", type = "source")
And then, use:
> library (matR)
to load the package, and finally use:
> dependencies ()
to install supporting packages.  Note: in a strict sense there are no dependencies, but without supporting packages, features will be unusable.

LOADING
During an R session, matR functionality is only available after loading the package with:
> library (matR)

HELP AND DOCUMENTATION
Once the package is loaded in an R session, use:
> demo (package = "matR")
for a list of short tutorial demos.  Run these with the regular R command demo() or the enhanced version demo2(), for instance:
> demo2 ("metadata")
To list prepackaged datasets, use:
> data (package = "matR")
For help and examples of use, per-function, try (for instance):
> ?collection
> utils::example ("collection")
And for general help, use:
> package?matR
